  // to indicate that the request isn't done just yet. When it's finished and we have data returned from the server, 
  // that information is stored in the destructured data property.

  // to conditionally render data based on whether or not there is data to even display.

  // tried to use it in a Node server, we'd receive a syntax error, because Node doesn't know what it is yet.

  // empty array to the thoughts component.
